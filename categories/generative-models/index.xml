      <description>Many Generative models have an infertence counter part. In this work we explore how they are formulated. We also studied their representation learning and generative capabilities theoretically and empirically.</description>

      <description>Amortized Gaussian Process is a model that amortizes the computation of a Gaussian Process. With this model we can use autoencoder for time series with variable length and irregular sampling.</description>

      <title>LGAd: Lightcurve generative model for anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://jumpynitro.github.io/blog/2022/07/lgad/</link>

      <description>We present LGAd, a variational autoencoder for anomaly detection in time series. Anomaly detection is fundamental task in astroinformatics that could allows us to find new astronomical objects not observed in the past.</description>
